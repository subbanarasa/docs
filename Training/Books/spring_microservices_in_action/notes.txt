Why change the way we build applications like microservice ? 

1. Complexity has gone way up -- means not to have single database for complete application.
2. Customers want faster delivery
3. Performance and scalability
4. Customers expect their application to be available

Small, Simple, and Decoupled Services = Scalable, Resilient, and Flexible Applications
