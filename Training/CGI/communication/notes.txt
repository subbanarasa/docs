Diversity and inclusion (D&I) is more than policies, programs, or headcounts. Equitable employers outpace their competitors by respecting the unique needs, perspectives and potential of all their team members


Diversity comes in many forms: gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, age, culture, socioeconomic background, etc. All of these contribute to an individual’s unique experience of the world.

Inclusion is defined as the state of being included or being made a part of something. When a book covers many different ideas and subjects, it is an example of the inclusion of many ideas. When multiple people are all invited to be part of a group, this is an example of the inclusion of many different people


Sometimes we need to take a step back and examine the presence of diversity in our own life. How diverse is your school? Neighborhood? Place of work? Group of friends? Is diversity something we should strive for in all aspects of our lives?




Adv: 

As a result, diverse and inclusive workplaces earn deeper trust and more commitment from their employees


Issues: 

When employees don’t feel that their ideas, presence or contributions are truly valued or taken seriously by their organization, they will eventually leave.



Our research on company culture shows that when employees trust that they, and their colleagues, will be treated fairly regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation or age, they are.

9.8 times more likely to look forward to going to work
6.3 times more likely to have pride in their work
5.4 times more likely to want to stay a long time at their company

Having an inclusive workplace culture will not only help you attract a diverse set of talent but also help you retain the diverse talent you attracted in the first place.


What is an inclusive workplace?

The diversity that lacks genuine inclusion is often called “tokenism.” An inclusive workplace doesn’t just have a diversity of people present, it has a diversity of people involved, developed, empowered and trusted by the business


1. TALENT 

	Inclusive Workplaces Maximize Talent and Productivity
	Diverse Organizations Are More Successful at Recruiting and Retaining Talent	
	
2. INNOVATION AND GROUP PERFORMANCE -  

	Diversity Reduces Groupthink and Enhances Decision-Making
	Inclusion Is Key to Team Performance
	
3. REPUTATION AND RESPONSIBILITY 
	
	Inclusion Boosts Company Reputation
	Mixed-Gender Boards Have Fewer Instances of Fraud
	Boardroom Diversity Strengthens Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Performance
	
4. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
	
	Companies in the top quartile for ethnic diversity at the executive level are 33 percent more likely to have above-average profitability than companies in the bottom quartile.
	
	companies in the top quartile are 21 percent more likely to have above-average profitability than companies in the bottom quartile, according to McKinsey’s research
	

Conclusion:
===========

Diversity and Inclusion is a top-to-bottom business strategy – not just an HR program.

The medical personnel who commit euthanasia suffer personal consequences.

Legalizing euthanasia would send a clear message: it is better to be dead than sick or disabled

Directly or indirectly, euthanasia imposes many pressures on the elderly and people with disabilities

Euthanasia is likely to increase the suicide rate.


Euthanasia could become an economical method of "treating" the terminally ill.



We know that euthanasia is increasing in countries that have legalized it: an increase of 18 % in the Netherlands in 2011, and another 13% increase in 2012. Moreover, according to The Lancet, 23% of cases of euthanasia are not reported


In Oregon, where assisted suicide has been legal since 1997, the number of reported assisted suicides has increased by 306%, but it is impossible to know what the real number, because the system designed to collect the data is flawed.


Euthanasia is against the intrinsic value and personal dignity.

Topic i have taken is story of great leader who inpiress you and why ?



Dr YS Rajasekhara Reddy popularly known as YSR, YSR was not just the most popular political leader of Andhra Pradesh but he was also as the most loved chief minister, he believed in welfare as the only vehicle to ensure peace and stability in the society 

YSR has started many welfare schemes like 
2 rs free rice, 
Free electiric for farmers, 
Jalayagnam , 
Free education and free health service . 

I would like talk about two welfare schemes which are most inspired to me i.e 

If we see in our sociaty majory of the people earnings is going to kids education and medical expences.

1. Free Education via Fees Reimbursement.
2. Free healthcare services via Arogya sri scheme. 



Fees Reimbursement: 
===================

YSR even had long term plans for the economic growth of the state by providing the best possible education to at least one person from every house through his 100 percent fees reimbursement scheme.

Education sponsorship Programme initiated by YSR who was strongly committed for empowerment of people by educating them.


When I was doing my engineering we were only two people who has done engineering in my village,  During YSR time I see almost every house miniumum one student doing engineering or other graduation.

I definately say that due to this scheme lot of poor family life style has improved lot . due educated childernes at their home. 




Arogya Sri:
===========

One of the flagship schemes of YSR his commitment to provide quality healthcare even for the poorest of the poor.

The government took care of all the medical emergencies up to a cost of Rs 2 lakhs and health issues of white cardholders in coporate hospitals in this scheme.

108 And 104 Services:
=====================

YSR is the introducer of starting 108 emergency ambulance scheme. Andhra Pradesh was the first state to implement it. YSR launched this scheme to help people reach hospitals during emergency situations with free of cost.


This amuplances reaches within 20-30 minutes to rural area people where no transportation available. This service saves lot of people lives.   


I would like say that lot of poor people medical emergencies treated as part of Arogya sri and saves their life.
