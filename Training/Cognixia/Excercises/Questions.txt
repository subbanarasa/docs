2. Create another Linux Instance in a same Region and AZ using same kind of configuration, and using this instance take the remote of first instance.



1. How you can differ between edge location and availability zones.
2. If you create an instance in One region can we see that instance in another region.
3. Can we add more than one EBS volumes with the same EC2 instance.
If yes, how?
4. Once the instance has been stopped, will AWS charge the amount the for the machine.
5. How many machines we can create in a Region by default?
6. Define the purpose of EC2 Security Group. Can we launch a VM without Security Group.
7. How many maximum number of Security Groups can be added to one instance?
8. What are the limitations of AWS Free Tier Account, please write in detail?
9. What maximum size of EBS volume under Free Tier can be taken.
