Can we use Kafka stream in other languages, say Rust?

There are native-APIs in a number of languages. For languages without a native client, see section in this presentation on using the REST API. See also https://www.confluent.io/blog/getting-started-with-rust-and-kafka/

When to use RAW topics (ie., without Schema) and when to use topics with Schema? Any best practice recommendation?

If you want to maintain a contract between producers and consumers on the format of messages, and especially if you want to be able to independently version that schema over time, you should apply a schema and use Schema Registry.

Does Kafka messages have a size limitation? if yes, what is it?

It is configurable. The default value is 1MB.

Can Kafka Connect perform some kind of data transformation through configuration?

Yes. Configuration known as Single Message Transforms (SMTs) can do this. Further processing can be done in KSQL or KStreams.

Can you share the link to the blog post about the exactly once semantics?

I like this one: https://www.confluent.io/blog/transactions-apache-kafka/ . This is also good: https://www.confluent.io/blog/exactly-once-semantics-are-possible-heres-how-apache-kafka-does-it/

Does producer and consumer client communicate with zookeeper or broker directly?

Kafka broker yes, unless you are using the Confluent REST Proxy. ZooKeeper no - and the number of tools which access ZooKeeper is on the decline as part of KIP-500 efforts.

Can you please share documentation on creating our own SMT?
