ADDITIONAL
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Widening vs. Boxing

class AddBoxing {
	static void go(Integer x) { System.out.println("Integer"); }
	static void go(long x) { System.out.println("long"); }
	public static void main(String [] args) {
	int i = 5;
	go(i); // which go() will be invoked ?
	}
}
-------
Widening and Boxing vs var args
class AddVarargs {
	static void go(int x, int y) { System.out.println("int,int");}
	static void go(byte... x) { System.out.println("byte... "); }
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		byte b = 5;
		go(b,b); // which go() will be invoked?
	}
}
------
class BoxOrVararg {
	static void go(Byte x, Byte y) { System.out.println("Byte, Byte"); }
	static void go(byte... x) { System.out.println("byte... "); }
	public static void main(String [] args) {
		byte b = 5;
		go(b,b); // which go() will be invoked?
	}
}
------------
class WidenAndBox {
	static void go(Long x) { System.out.println("Long"); }
	public static void main(String [] args) {
		byte b = 5;
		go(b); // will this compile ?
	}
}
---------------------
class BoxAndWiden {
	static void go(Object o) {
		Byte b2 = (Byte) o; //  - it's a Byte object
		System.out.println(b2);
	}
	public static void main(String [] args) {
		byte b = 5;
		go(b); Will this compile ?
	}
}

class Cat { } 
class Dog { }
d instanceof Cat // If d is of type Dog, will this expression compile ?

System.out.println(a + b + c); What will be the result ?

------

for( ; ; ) { System.out.println("Running");}  // Will this compile, what will be the result ?
